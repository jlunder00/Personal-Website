I graduated in Computer Science and Mathematics from Gonzaga University in May 2023 and have experience in cutting edge AI Research.    
Most recently, I worked as a Machine Learning/Data Science intern at Gestalt Diagnostics.    
In my spare time, I work on a variety of projects in NLP, CV, and other areas of ML/AI    

## Experience
Machine Learning / Data Science Intern at Gestalt Diagnostics    
Research Assistant at the Gonzaga University Center for Complex Systems    
Research Assistant for a Gonzaga University sponsored Tripping Hazard Detection project    

## Projects
I build models and infrastructure for machine learning systems, including:    
  - A system of various CV models for assisting pathologists diagnosing cancer    
  - A novel lemma dependency tree based machine translation model    
  - A model for detecting if a research paper's abstract is AI generated    
  - A system for detecting tripping hazards with a Microsoft Hololens v2    

I led the Gonzaga Robotics Computer Science and Machine Learning team in designing and developing a control system for a mars rover
I contributed to the 2022 ACROBAT Grand Challenge winning image registration model for histology images    
I developed an RPA based system for automating IT processes at Lynden Inc.     
I helped organize one of the largest online communities in Gonzaga University history
