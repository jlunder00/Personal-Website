Founding Software/ML Engineer at Intellipat Inc. \([intellipat.ai](https://intellipat.ai) & [console.intellipat.ai](https://console.intellipat.ai)\)    

At Intellipat, I build AI and software systems for patents and intellectual property law.    

I graduated from Gonzaga University with a BS in Computer Science and a BS in Mathematics in 2023.    
During my undergrad, I worked as a Machine Learning/Data Science intern at Gestalt Diagnostics.    
I am currently pursuing a MS in Computer Science at Eastern Washington University, defending my thesis Winter 2026.    
In my spare time, I work on a variety of projects in NLP, CV, and other areas of ML/AI, including at [Parsimony](https://p7y.ai)       

## Experience
Founding Software/ML Engineer at Intellipat Inc. / Pangeon Corp.     
Team Lead at Parsimony    
Machine Learning / Data Science Intern at Gestalt Diagnostics    
Research Assistant at the Gonzaga University Center for Complex Systems    

## Research
### Interests
 - Natural Language Processing, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning    
 - Interested in utilizing structure-aware language representation, especially tree-based models that leverage linguistic structure.    
 - Exploring how combining unstructured yet scalable linguistic representation and structured linguistic representation can improve efficiency, interpretability, and safety in AI systems.

### Working on now
#### Tree Matching Networks     
 - Adapting graph neural network architecture for natural language inference using dependency parse trees.    
 - Demonstrates that explicit structural encoding outperforms transformer baselines at small scales.    
 - Master's thesis (Winter 2026) investigates self-attention aggregation to address known scaling challenges in structure-based approaches.       

### Publications and Preprints
Lunder, J. (2025). _Tree Matching Networks for Natural Language Inference: Parameter-Efficient Semantic Understanding via Dependency Parse Trees._ In preparation.

## Projects
I build models and infrastructure for machine learning systems, including:    
    
 - A system for determining if an invention is novel in the context of all patents    
 - A system of various CV models for assisting pathologists diagnosing cancer    
 - A novel lemma dependency tree based machine translation model    

I led the Gonzaga Robotics Computer Science and Machine Learning team in designing and developing a control system for a mars rover    
I contributed to the 2022 ACROBAT Grand Challenge winning image registration model for histology images      
I developed an RPA based system for automating IT processes at Lynden Inc.    
I helped organize one of the largest online communities in Gonzaga University history
